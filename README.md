There are some questions can be answered in our manual, some can be answered by searching the Internet, and some we have not mentioned which need to be added to our manual. We welcome the third one because the answers to the first two questions are readily available. To give you faster access to the answers, you need to take a look at this article [提问的智慧](https://github.com/ryanhanwu/How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way/blob/master/README-zh_CN.md).
