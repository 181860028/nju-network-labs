Details Our lab assignments are based on CS640 in Wisconsin University. Most materials are the same. In the future, we will improve the experimantal content based on feedback. For this lab assignment, you will gradually master our experimental environment. But we need you to know some basic skills, such as how to develope on linux or how to program. If you are not familiar with these, please tell TAs. We will list some helpful materials for you to get started quickly. First, you need to complete setting up your enviroment. Read section prerequisites. "},"content/ch00/prerequisites.html":{"url":"content/ch00/prerequisites.html","title":"Prerequisites","keywords":"","body":"Prerequisites Virtual Machine We are providing you with a Ubuntu 18.04 (64-bit) VM image for this assignment. This image has Switchyard, Mininet and Wireshark installed so you do not need to worry about setting up the enviroment. You can find the VM image here. (user name: njucs - password: 123) You can learn more about importing a VM image in VirtualBox here. You are also free to use your favorite vitualization software for importing the image but you will most probably have to deal with the possible issues on yourself. If you are a free soul and want to setup Switchyard in a different environment you are welcome to do that as well. You can find some useful information here. This might or might not be useful for you depending on your environment.
