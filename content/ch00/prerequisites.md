# Prerequisites

## Virtual Machine

We are providing you with a Ubuntu 18.04 (64-bit) VM image for this assignment. This image has Switchyard, Mininet and Wireshark installed so you do not need to worry about setting up the enviroment.

- You can find the VM image [here](https://box.nju.edu.cn/d/123a70ac8ff34595b18f/).

- You can learn more about importing a VM image in VirtualBox [here](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26217_01/E26796/html/qs-import-vm.html).

You are also free to use your favorite vitualization software for importing the image but you will most probably have to deal with the possible issues on yourself.

If you are a free soul and want to setup Switchyard in a different environment you are welcome to do that as well. You can find some useful information [here](../../appendix/environment-setup.md). This might or might not be useful for you depending on your environment.
