# Lab 0: Switchyard & Mininet

## Overview

In this chapter we will introduce all preparations for our network experiments.

## Details

Our lab assignments are based on CS640 in Wisconsin University. Most materials are the same. In the future, we will improve the experimantal content based on feedback.

For this lab assignment, you will gradually master our experimental environment. But we need you to know some basic skills, such as how to develope on linux or how to program. If you are not familiar with these, please tell TAs. We will list some helpful materials for you to get started quickly.

First, you need to complete setting up your enviroment. Read section [Prerequisites](./prerequisites.md).
