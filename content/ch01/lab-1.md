# Lab 1: Switchyard & Mininet

## Overview

In this chapter we will introduce all preparations for our network experiments. Then your are going to modify the examples we provide according to our requirements.

## Details

Our lab assignments are based on CS640 in University of Wisconsin. Most materials are the same. In the future, we will improve the experiment based on your feedback.

In this lab assignment, you will gradually master our experimental environment. But some preliminary abilities are required in our experiments such as how to program and debug in Linux. If you are not familiar with these, feel free to contact TAs. We will provide you with some helpful information to get started quickly.

### Platform

The platform of our labs is Switchyard. You can implement a device with various functions in Switchyard by writing Python codes. Then you can run your device in Mininet and capture packets using Wireshark. You will use Git to manage your projects and submit them. All these software are installed on Linux. We recommend using Visual Studio Code as your editor.

Here is the list of softwares we mentioned (sorted by learning order).

- Linux
- Python
- Git
- Mininet
- Wireshark
- Switchyard
- VS Code

### Task 1: Get Ready

Read the section [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) and meet the requirements for using Linux, Python and Git. We assume that you have a basic understanding of these contents.

### Task 2: An Example

Read the section [workflow](workflow.md) and meet the requirements for using Mininet, Wireshark and Switchyard. At the meantime you will learn how to complete this assignment.

### Task 3: Your Modification

After task 2, you are able to do some exercises on our platform.

1. In the section [Mininet](mininet.md), we introduced how to construct a topology. So here we have two options for you, choose **one** to implement. Then show the details of how you build the topology in your report.
  - Delete `server2` in the topology,
  - Or create a different topology containing 6 nodes using hosts and hubs (don't use other kind of devices).
2. In the section [Switchyard](switchyard.md), we introduced how to program a device. Your task is to count how many packets pass through a hub both in and out. You need to log it out every time you receive one packet with the format of each line `<timestamp> in:<ingress packet count> out:<egress packet count>`. Then show the log of your hub and how you implement it in your report.
3. In the section [Switchyard](switchyard.md), we introduced how to write the test case. So here we have two options for you, choose **one** to implement. Then show the details of your test cases in your report.
  - Create one test case by using the given function `mk_pkt` with different fields,
  - Or create one test case with your handmade packet.
4. In the section [Switchyard](switchyard.md), we introduced how to run Switchyard programs in Mininet. So run your new hubs in your new topology and make sure it works. Show the procedure in your report.
5. Both in section [Wireshark](wireshark.md) and [Switchyard](switchyard.md), we introduced how to capture packets. In your own topology, capture packets on one host (no hub) while creating some traffic. **Save your capture file** and submit it with your report and code. Also you need to describe the details of your capture file.

## Handing it in

### Report

We will provide a template of your lab assignment report [here](https://box.nju.edu.cn/d/123a70ac8ff34595b18f/). You need to submit the report in your repository named `<学号><姓名>_lab_1`. The format of your report can be Microsoft Doc or PDF. An example is `123456789拾佰仟_lab_1.docx`.

### Capture file

The capture file's name should be `lab_1.pcap`. If you capture packets using *superuser*, you may meet some problems. Read the tips below.

> [!WARNING]
> You may (or as I expect you must) meet the error when you try to modify/delete the files generated by Wireshark or Switchyard programs running on hosts in Mininet. It is because the owner of these files is superuser `root`. You need to change the owner to your login user. Run the command below on your capture file. Replace `<file>` to the file path of your capture file.
> ```
> $ sudo chown $USER:$USER <file>
> ```
> Another useful command `ls -l` can check if the owner of the file is `root`. You can see the file belonging to `root` is `test.log` in the example.
> ```
> (syenv) cyq@cyq-VirtualBox:~/switchyard$ ls -l
> total 88
> -rw-rw-r-- 1 cyq  cyq  35147 2月  20 17:33 COPYING

> -rw-rw-r-- 1 cyq  cyq   2266 2月  20 17:33 setup.py
> drwxrwxr-x 4 cyq  cyq   4096 2月  20 17:33 switchyard
> drwxrwxr-x 6 cyq  cyq   4096 2月  20 17:37 syenv
> -rw-r--r-- 1 root root   181 2月  21 21:42 lab_1.pcap
> drwxrwxr-x 2 cyq  cyq   4096 2月  20 17:33 tests
> ```
> In this case, running the command `sudo chown $USER:$USER ./lab_1.pcap` can change the owner to my user `cyq`.
> As we mentioned before, be careful when using `sudo` since it may have potential risks.

### Submit to NJU GitLab

To submit your work, you need to do the following things at the first time

1. Sign up on https://git.nju.edu.cn with your own NJU email account.

2. Sign in.

3. Import the repository https://git.nju.edu.cn/njucn-2020-spring/switchyard to your own account and make it private, then you will get your own repository url. Here is a brief guide in one picture about how to import the project. **Don't fork** because that makes your repository public.

  ![Import repository](assets/import-repo.png)

4. Share your repository with us.

   1. Find "Members" in "Settings" of your repository.

   2. In "Invite group", select `njucn-2020-spring` and make us as "Reporter" or "Developer".

5. There is a directory `~/switchyard` in your virtual machine (if you use the VM image we provide). Set the remote repository of `switchyard` to your repository url by running the command `git remote set-url origin <your repository url>`. Otherwise, clone your own remote repository.

6. Create a directory named `lab_1` in `switchyard`. Your should start by copying the template files `examples/start_mininet.py`, `examples/myhub.py` and `examples/hubtests.py` into `lab_1`. And your project will look like

  ```
    switchyard/
      ├─docs/
      ├─.../
    + ├─lab_1/
    + │ ├─hubtests.py
    + │ ├─myhub.py
    + │ └─start_mininet.py
      ├─.gitignore
      └─...
  ```

Then complete Task 3. When you are ready to submit, do the following.

1. Modify your code according to Task 3, complete your report and save your capture file.

  > [!WARNING]
  > All of your modifications should be done on the files under your directory `lab_1`. We will check and compare the **git commits** to judge the originality of your work. So remember to commit every time you complete one small task.

2. When you have done your work, put your report, code and capture file in the folder `lab_1` and commit them. Tag the commit named `<学号/lab_1>` which you want to submit. An example is `123456789/lab_1`. For more about tag, read [Git 基础 - 打标签](https://git-scm.com/book/zh/v2/Git-%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80-%E6%89%93%E6%A0%87%E7%AD%BE). Finally your project will look like

  ```
    switchyard/
      ├─docs/
      ├─.../
    m ├─lab_1/
    + │ ├─123456789拾佰仟_lab_1.docx
    m │ ├─hubtests.py
    + │ ├─lab_1.pcap
    m │ ├─myhub.py
    m │ └─start_mininet.py
      ├─.gitignore
      └─...
  ```

  > [!WARNING]
  > The file names in your submission have to **exactly** match the file names above. Otherwise, you will lose points!

3. Submit your work by pushing your local repository to your remote repository **with your tags** by running the command `git push origin --tags`.

  > [!WARNING]
  > **Only** commit your **source code** to your local repository. If there are some generated files that are not source code, ignore them by adding them in the file `.gitignore`.
